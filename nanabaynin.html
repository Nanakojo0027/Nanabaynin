                   is a very precious gift.
               </strong>"<h3>Heading</h3><p></p> Human life is truly a very precious gift. Each moment of human life carries us an opportunity, to act to develop and express our virtues. Every moment unlocks the path to us to receive blessings. This is the truth that life gives us both positive and negative situations. What is really important is how we react.
               Life is the gift of God in the form of trust that we will make it meaningful in whatever we can. We are all unique individuals. No one is born like you and no one will ever be, so cherish your individuality. Many times, I come across people accusing God of things that they don’t have. The smaller your reality, the more convinced you are that you know everything.", "If the facts don't fit the theory, change the facts.", "The past has no power over the present moment.", "This, too, will pass.", "</p><p>You will not be punished for your anger, you will be punished by your anger.", "Peace comes from within. Do not seek it without.",Life is nothing but a journey with lessons, hardships, heartache and special moments. It will ultimately lead us to our destination, our purpose in life. The road will not always be a plane; in fact, throughout our travels, we will face many challenges.
                These challenges will always test our courage, strengths, weaknesses, and faith. Along our way, we may encounter obstacles that will come between the paths and we are destined to take.
                In order to be on the right path, we must overcome these obstacles. Sometimes these obstacles are really blessings in disguise, only we don’t understand that at the time. The secret of life is best known to those who are not attached to anything deeply so much.
                Therefore, they remain out of touch with worries and shifting fortunes of their lives. They are the people who do not measure their lives in terms of materialistic possessions, but by measuring their lives in terms of people they cannot live without ."<h3>CONCLUSION</h4><p></p>The most important moment of your life is now. The most important person in your life is the one you are with now, and the most important activity in your life is the one you are involved with now.My name is Lamptey Josiah(10949333) and what choice will you make when you leave here today? Will you listen to me , or will you go about your normal routine?
